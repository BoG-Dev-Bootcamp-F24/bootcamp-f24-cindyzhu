            My name is Cindy and I am a second-year Computer Science major.
            I enjoy helping others by teaching a variety of topics like calculus, 
            chemistry, and statistics to people whenever they have trouble 
            understanding a topic. I love watching people be able to develop their 
            own understanding of a subject through my guidance, and watching 
            them find enjoyment in the topics they're learning.
